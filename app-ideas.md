# App Ideas
Here is a listing of the app ideas that are being considered for the club's year-long project.

## Kan Jam Mobile Game
- See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWsB3YFG4hE) for a demo on how Kan Jam is played
- Mobile game to simulate Kan Jam
- Could use flick controls (similar to Paper Toss) or accelerometer/gyroscope controls to simulate frisbee throws

## Trading Card Inventory Tracker
- Track a collection of Magic, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, or sports cards and arrange them into decks
- Use existing databases and APIs to get data about each card
- Scrape ebay, Amazon, and other shopping sites to get an approximate price for each card
- Add cards to your collection by scanning them with your camera
 - Would require machine learning and computer vision to figure out what card is being scanned

## Virtual Pet
- Inspired by Tamogatchi: feed, play with, clean up after, and customize a virtual pet
- Mini games
- Have some pedometer functionality (inspired by PokeWalker)
- Location based social networking to link up with other pets
