# TCNJ Mobile Application Development Club

Welcome to TCNJ MADC's official GitHub repo, where you can find club announcements and resources from tutorials given at meetings.

This semester, meetings will (tentatively) be held every **Wednesday from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM** in the **Mac Lab** on the fourth floor of Forcina. Due to scheduling concerns of some members and a CS course that uses the lab at 5:30, this time may be adjusted for the meetings to come.

## This Week's Meeting

Our first official meeting of the semester will be held on **Wednesday, September 9 from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM** in the **Mac Lab**. We'll be talking about our plan to work collectively on a single mobile app throughout the year. Once we cover the basics of Android and iOS, our tutorials will be focused on implementing various features of our app.

There aren't any app ideas floating around yet, so come with ideas! There are no restrictions on ideas; they can be for games, utilities, or apps that already exist. The focus of building an app together is to learn mobile development skills and collaborate in an interesting way. See you there!
