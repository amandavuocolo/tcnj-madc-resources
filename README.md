# TCNJ Mobile Application Development Club

Welcome to TCNJ MADC's official GitHub repo, where you can find club announcements and resources from tutorials given at meetings.

This semester, meetings will (tentatively) be held every **Wednesday from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM** in the **Mac Lab** on the fourth floor of Forcina. Due to scheduling concerns of some members and a CS course that uses the lab at 5:30, this time may be adjusted for the meetings to come.

## This Week's Meeting

This week's meeting will be held on **Wednesday, September 16 from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM** in the **Mac Lab**.

We're going to walk through installations for Android Studio and Xcode for Android and iOS development. We'll also talk about the app ideas again and get another round of voting for those who have not heard about the ideas yet. You can look at the app ideas that are currently being considered [on this page](https://github.com/bgottlob/tcnj-madc-resources/blob/master/app-ideas.md).
